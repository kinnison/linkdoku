# General

Markdown is a relatively natural way to express formatted text. You can use it
to create **bold** or _italic_ text with ease, and you can create headings,
links, include images, etc. The majority of Markdown constructs look like you'd
imagine you might write something if you were typing plain text.

As you edit the text, you can pop over to the `Preview` tab to see how

- **Bold** text is written as `**Bold**`
- _Italic_ text is written as `_Italic_`
- You can create links, such as [this one](https://linkdoku.net/) like this: `[this one](https://linkdoku.net)`
- And bulleted lists like this are just lines starting with a star (or a dash) and a space, `* like this` or `- like this`
- You can have "preformatted" or "code" text by using `` `backticks` ``

Paragraphs in Markdown are separated by blank lines, and you can create headings
by putting one or more hash symbols at the start. `# Big title` `## Smaller title` etc.
The more hashes, the smaller the title.

Images are included in Markdown like this: `![Alt text](https://path-to-image/)`.

If you want to know more, you can refer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

just the [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
